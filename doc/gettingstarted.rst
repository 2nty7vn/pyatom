Getting Started
===============

ATOMac requires a system running OS X and Xcode installed. It has been tested extensively on 10.6. 10.5 may work. If you experience issues with ATOMac on a particular version of OS X, please open a ticket in the issue tracker.

Systemwide accessibility must be enabled. Check the checkbox: System Preferences > Universal Access > Enable access for assistive devices. Failure to enable this will result in ErrorAPIDisabled exceptions during some module usage.

Installation should be as simple as running the following command line, which will download, build and install ATOMac::

$ sudo easy_install atomac
